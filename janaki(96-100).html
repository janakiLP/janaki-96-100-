    <p class="a"><i>Figure 3. Privacy versus suboptimal care risk: Possible patient/consumer view</i></p>
    <img src="figure1.png">
    <p class="a">Therefore the hypothetical clinician’s opinion (Figure 1) may be shaped by the perspec-<br>
        tive that, on balance, the greatest risk our communities face is a whole range of sub-<br>
        optimal care, that at least in part is attributable to the poor flow and integration of health<br>
        information. Based on this hypothesis, better integrated health information leads to<br>
        better integrated healthcare, the desired outcome from an effective health knowledge<br>
        management system would be to shift the norm of the health outcomes curve towards<br>
        the optimal end of the curve minimising the degree of sub-optimal care</p>
    <p class="a">However while not disputing the desire to minimise sub-optimal care, a patient may<br>
        perceive the relative risks differently (Figure 3). It is currently, and likely to remain,<br>
        difficult to provide “evidence” based data on relative privacy versus sub-optimal care<br>
        risks to an individual or indeed populations, as there will be strong perceptual differences<br>
        as to what the scope of that evidence should be and how it should be weighed. However<br>
        we could assume the relative risk graphs are unlikely to be reflected by straight lines. The<br>
        relative risks are likely to be influenced by individual perception, respective roles, the<br>
        nature of the data, and to change over time. The frequency, imminence, likelihood, and<br>
        magnitude of risk would also need to be considered, as would the ability to identify,<br>
        evaluate, manage, and review risk.</p>
    <p class="a">In the absence of definitive data, and with the recognition that the perceived risk arising<br>
        from a privacy infringement has such a personal perceptual component, it is important<br>
        to highlight some of the views and perceptions with regard to this matter</p>
    <p class="a">It could be argued, that severe physical disability or death is unlikely except in the case<br>
        of a privacy infringement leading to severe psychological distress resulting in attempted<br>
        or completed suicide. However there are a number of counter arguments to this. These<br>
        suggest that what we do now even with good intention could have future potentially<br>
        unforeseen but not unforeseeable adverse impacts. These suggest that there is not only<br>
        the potential for sub-optimal care, but also for active discrimination if not persecution<br>
        and political or regime sanctioned killings.</p>
    <p class="a">Perceived risk of a privacy infringement may lead to a patient withholding information,<br>
        or delaying presentation to health services. This may result in delayed investigation and</p>
    <p class="a">treatment and potentially sub-optimal care including avoidable morbidity and death. This<br>
        morbidity may extend to others particularly in the case of infectious diseases, not least<br>
        partners and unborn children in the case of sexually transmitted diseases.
        </p>
    <p class="a">Current data integration, data mining, risk prediction, and genetic profiling developments<br>
        have the potential for great benefit for our communities. However there is also the risk<br>
        that without appropriate regulation, certain segments of the populations could be<br>
        identified at high health risk and become unemployable, uninsurable and unable to obtain<br>
        credit, a mortgage or appropriate affordable healthcare (Kennedy, 2004).</p>
    <p class="a">Insurers and employers are generally not innately bad. They are businesses charged with<br>
        making a profit (or minimising loss) by their shareholders, and can be expected to use<br>
        every legal means and loophole possible to identify and manage their risk particularly<br>
        if it gives them an advantage over a competitor.</p>
    <p class="a">However it can be argued that the potential unfettered ability of insurance companies<br>
        and health management organisations to be progressively able to segment or cut up<br>
        the market, and discard those least profitable should be a concern for every<br>
        community.</p>
    <h4 class="b">Unique Health Identification Numbers</h4>
    <hr class="horizan">
    <p class="a">Unique health identification numbers can facilitate the process of data integration across<br>
        multiple electronic systems, and lead to better-integrated care. It can also be argued that<br>
        within the context of a large integrated electronic system they may decrease privacy or<br>
        security risk by minimising the amount of non secure activity around bringing a<br>
        disintegrated paper record together, such as multiple phone calls to other services<br>
        inquiring as to the availability of records, and the subsequent transfer of paper records</p>
    <p class="a">However, it can be argued that if there is an infringement of an integrated unique identifier<br>
        based electronic system, there is the opportunity for thousands of records to be<br>
        accessed, with unique identifiers facilitating access to a wide range of comprehensive<br>
        health information. An infringement could in theory be the result of a hacker gaining<br>
        unauthorised access to the health network. However, of likely greater risk is a health<br>
        service staff member, acting out of curiosity, malice or pecuniary gain, or having simply<br>
        been misled or talked into it by someone posing as a patient or clinician on the telephone.<br>
        This latter method of infringement has been highlighted by Anderson (1996). The risk<br>
        of staff access, facilitating a range of crimes including murder has also entered the<br>
        popular fictional literature (Gerritsen, 2001), also shaping community perceptions.</p>
    <p class="a">It could also be argued that significant parts of humanity’s past and present has been<br>
        dominated by war, invasion, totalitarian regimes, and state sanctioned terror, and even<br>
        those of us currently living in relatively benign environments are naïve to believe that<br>
        such horrors will not feature in our future. Such invading or totalitarian regimes have and<br>
        would use every means possible to control and terrorise the population, including health<br>
        data. The provision therefore of a national unique health identification number could<br>
        facilitate this process, including the singling out of specific subgroups for discrimina-<br>
        tion, persecution or killing (Black, 2001).</p>
    <p class="a">There are also general privacy infringement concerns, including health information<br>
        systems, being cross referenced, or matched with other government systems including<br>
        social services, benefits and police, and the use of data for unauthorised research or<br>
        commercial purposes</p>
    <p class="a">Are patient privacy concerns sometimes just a smokescreen for clinician privacy<br>
        concerns? Are clinicians sometimes just trying to minimize the transparency of a whole<br>
        range of issues from limitations of their skill and efficiency to fraudulent practice? It is<br>
        understandable why many clinicians would find these questions challenging if not<br>
        insulting. However in terms of exploring the challenges that might impact on the effective<br>
        implementation of health knowledge management systems, they are perspectives that<br>
        cannot be ignored, and following is a brief limited discussion of some of the potential<br>
        underlying issues.</p>
    <p class="a">Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) or the concept that treatment choices should be based<br>
        on, or backed by, the best evidence available, has unfortunately in many situations,<br>
        become perceived as an excuse for “evidence bound” medicine. That is the establishment<br>
        of rigid regimes, or marked limitation of treatment choices that stifle innovation or new<br>
        developments and do not recognise individual patient variation. This has particularly<br>
        become associated with the term “managed care”. Managed care is a concept that in its<br>
        pure form has some worth, as it promotes the idea of effective clinical care pathways and<br>
        efficient targeted integrated use of resources. However the form of “managed care”<br>
        espoused by profit focused health organisations, and insurance companies is perceived<br>
        as having little to do with effectively managing care in the patients interests, but<br>
        everything to do with managing costs and subsequently maximising profits.</p>
    <p class="a">Accordingly clinicians may be rightly concerned with respect to whether, Health<br>
        Information Management Systems that propose to support “evidence based medicine”<br>
        and “quality management” are not just Trojan Horses, implemented with purely financial<br>
        goals that will lead to a state of “evidence bound medicine” (Orr, 2000).</p>
    <p class="a">It can be argued that in a fee-for-service environment concerns for patient privacy may<br>
        be a smokescreen to prevent monitoring of over-servicing and over-investigation and<br>
        subsequent over-claiming. Unfortunately this argument might have some credence, but<br>
        hopefully it applies to only a small minority of clinicians.</p>
    <p class="a">The clinician population, just like the patient population, will have a spectrum of views<br>
        and needs and behaviours with regard to their own personal privacy. The view that those<br>
        who are doing nothing wrong have nothing to worry about may have some validity, but<br>
        it does not dismiss the fact that some of those who have done nothing wrong will worry,<br>
        or certainly will not enjoy or embrace their employing, funding or regulatory body’s<br>
        ability to closely monitor or control their behaviour.</p>
    <p class="a">Clinicians may rightly question a health information management system’s capacity for<br>
        “evidence building medicine”, the potential to support research and effectively improve<br>
        clinical processes from their perspective and to augment their clinical skill and profes-<br>
        sionalism.</p>
    <p class="a">Coiera and Clark (2003) have comprehensively described some of the parameters,<br>
        complexities, and potential solutions for the concept of “e-consent” with regard to the<br>
        handling of electronic patient information. It may be useful to focus on some of the<br>
        perceived potential limitations or challenges of the concept (or more specifically the</p>
    <p class="a">concept of so called “informed consent”) in practice, when it interacts with the complex<br>
        system of health and clinical care information flows and utilisation. As a context to this<br>
        discussion, a series of perspectives, and metaphors about how the current health system<br>
        (and particularly clinical practice) functions is presented.</p>
    <p class="a">Informed consent implies some form of formal risk benefit analysis; or at least that a<br>
        patient is freely consenting to a particular action having been appropriately informed of<br>
        the potential risks and benefits of such an action. In relation to an electronic Health<br>
        Information System, informed consent can be used to imply that a patient, based on<br>
        perceived privacy risk, should have the right to suppress certain information, or to<br>
        prevent certain caregivers from viewing specific information. Additionally, to protect<br>
        privacy, it can be argued the caregiver should be given no indication that information<br>
        has been suppressed or is deliberately being withheld from their view. One argument that<br>
        can be used for this is that patients have always withheld information from caregivers,<br>
        and caregivers have always been willing to make incomplete notes on patient’s request.</p>
    <p class="a">A caregiver utilises a Health Knowledge System with a view to making more effective or<br>
        optimal decisions about a patient’s care. A clinician may recognise that, just like a paper<br>
        record, the electronic record may not always be complete accurate and timely. However<br>
        is it acceptable for an employer to provide systems that can deliberately deceive or<br>
        mislead a clinician by suppressing information, while giving no indication that informa-<br>
        tion is being withheld?</p>
    <p class="a">Biopsychosocial Healthcare (Engel, 1977) should be related to Biopsychosocial Pattern<br>
        Recognition. Healthcare that seeks to address a patient’s illness or disease, not just as<br>
        biological pathology, but within a psychosocial context, needs to have an understanding<br>
        of that context. From an information system perspective, assistance with pathology<br>
        recognition and general treatment advice may be helpful, for example if a patient presents<br>
        with certain symptoms and signs, the clinician is provided with list of potential diagnoses<br>
        and general investigation and management advice.</p>
    <p class="a">However, for optimal biopsychosocial healthcare, it is important to know an individual’s<br>
        specific risk profile and psychosocial circumstances, their coping mechanisms and<br>
        supports and how they may have progressed and responded in the past, with the aim of<br>
        facilitating individualised chronic care and task management. Pattern recognition and<br>
        appropriate interventions are often related to subtle changes for that specific patient.<br>
        Longitudinal history and knowing not just how a patient is presenting now but how they<br>
        have presented and responded over time is one of the major benefits of a longstanding<br>
        relationship between a patient and a trusted clinician.</p>
    <p class="a">In an environment where patient and clinician relationships may be increasingly fragmen-<br>
        tary, with multiple short term interventions by multiple caregivers, a health knowledge<br>
        system should seek to act as an organisational glue and organisational memory, holding<br>
        together and integrating both the shared collective and longitudinal knowledge of a<br>
        patient and appropriately co-ordinated responses.</p>
    <p class="a">A Health Knowledge System should aim to bring together as soon as possible the<br>
        required “pieces” that will increase the “capacity to act” (Sveiby, 2001), or capacity to<br>
        C.A.R.E. (that is the capacity to deliver in a coordinated fashion the integral clinical,<br>
        administrative, research and educational functions of healthcare). Like a jigsaw, the more<br>
        pieces already in place, the quicker it is to start seeing the overall picture and what pieces</p>
    <p class="a">(areas) best to solve next. Indeed, in terms of biopsychosocial pattern recognition, a<br>
        clinician may sometimes think they are working on putting together the pieces to build<br>
        one picture, but get more pieces and realise they are actually working on another</p>
    <p class="a">Media reviews of adverse events or deaths using a “retrospectascope” often see simple<br>
        clarity where none was evident to clinicians involved at the time. Using the<br>
        “retrospectascope” often one can see all the pieces of the jigsaw at a single place and<br>
        point in time when in reality the pieces will have emerged from multiple sources over time.<br>
        In reality, a clinician often needs to solve the jigsaw, as if riding around it in a roller coaster<br>
        through a dark tunnel with only glimpses from different perspectives of not only the index<br>
        problem, but multiple problems for multiple patients they may be being asked to solve<br>
        at the same time.</p>
    <p class="a">A machine or computerised jigsaw, with increasing levels of intelligence, could bring<br>
        pieces together for you, sort and frame pieces into groups and provide decision support<br>
        telling you a piece is missing or a piece cannot go here as it does not fit with another (e.g.,<br>
        preventing medication errors). If you switch on the privacy mode of this “intelligent”<br>
        jigsaw should it place mittens on you, slowing the problem solving process or say “sorry<br>
        you cannot see that piece” or even withhold pieces without even telling you? There will<br>
        undoubtedly be situations where the withholding of specific information from specific<br>
        caregivers can be justified. However the concept of informed consent should at least seek<br>
        to convey an understanding of not just the perceived privacy risks and benefits of<br>
        information flowing or not flowing, but also the clinical risks and benefits.</p>
    <p class="a">However there are different perceptions or perspectives of what those risks and benefits<br>
        are, and these can differ for each disorder, patient, caregiver, and can vary over time. For<br>
        example information typically considered sensitive includes that related to infectious<br>
        and sexually transmitted diseases, alcohol, and drug and mental health history and<br>
        obstetric and gynaecological history (particularly in relation to induced abortion).</p>
    <p class="a">However some patients may consider, for example a family or personal history of<br>
        carcinoma as, or more, sensitive while one clinician suggested he would be more worried<br>
        about an insurance company (via their GP) checking his lipids. We also need to consider<br>
        the time and resource implications of information flow “informed consent” processes and<br>
        how realistic it is at the time of information collection to make decisions on all information<br>
        collected in terms of its current and future information flows; for example, that information<br>
        item A can go to Doctor A but not Doctor B or Nurse C, but item C can only be viewed<br>
        by Doctor D. In the common situation of resource limitation and prioritisation it can be<br>
        argued there may be a pragmatic need for “implied consent”, with the patient having to<br>
        actively indicate they want a particularly piece of information limited in its flow.</p>
    <p class="a">Similarly it can be argued that it is misleading to even attempt to utilise the concept of<br>
        informed consent to imply that a health service can truly offer a patient the option of<br>
        control over their information flows. There may be clinical, statutory, regulatory or<br>
        financial requirements that require a clinician or health service to pass certain information<br>
        or partial information to other bodies. A clinician or health service can do their best to<br>
        make a patient aware of the nature and purpose of the information they are collecting and<br>
        how it may be utilised, but it is misleading to imply that the patient has total, un-coerced<br>
        control over that information, for which they can freely offer or withdraw consent.</p>
